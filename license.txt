 The "Artistic License" 
Preamble 
The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package 
may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of 
artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of 
the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less 
customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications. 
Definitions: 
"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright 
Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual 
modification. 
"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has 
been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder as 
specified below. 
"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the 
package. 
"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package. 
"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media 
cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not 
be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing 
community at large as a market that must bear the fee.) 
"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though 
there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients 
of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it. 
1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the 
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you 
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. 
2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived 
from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in 
such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version. 
3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that 
you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you 
changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following: 
a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely 
Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent 
medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as 
uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications 
in the Standard Version of the Package. 
b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization. 
c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with 
standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate 
manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it 
differs from the Standard Version. 
d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. 
4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable 
form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following: 
a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, 
together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get 
the Standard Version. 
License/Notice:
 with your modifications. 
c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document the 
differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on 
where to get the Standard Version. 
d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. 
5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this 
Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You 
may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this 
Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a 
larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not 
advertise this Package as a product of your own. You may embed this Package's 
interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed 
as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of 
the interpreter is so embedded. 
6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output 
from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright 
of this Package, but belong to whoever generated them, and may be sold 
commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package. If such scripts or 
library files are aggregated with this Package via the so-called "undump" or 
"unexec" methods of producing a binary executable image, then distribution of 
such an image shall neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor 
shall it fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you 
do not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this Package. 
7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages) 
supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines 
and variables of the language defined by this Package shall not be considered 
part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, 
provided these subroutines do not change the language in any way that would 
cause it to fail the regression tests for the language. 
8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always 
permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no 
overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible to the end user 
of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a 
distribution of this Package. 
9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote 
products derived from this software without specific prior written permission. 
10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Version 1, February 1989 
Copyright (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA 
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed. 
Preamble 
The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the 
mercy of those companies. By contrast, our General Public License is intended 
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
with your modifications.
 Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors 
commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too. 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. 
Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have 
the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive 
source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or 
use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these 
things. 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny 
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions 
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the 
software, or if you modify it. 
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for 
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must 
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must 
tell them their rights. 
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) 
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute 
and/or modify the software. 
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the 
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to 
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced 
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. 
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a 
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the 
terms of this General Public License. 
The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on 
the Program" means either the Program or any work containing the Program or a 
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is 
addressed as "you". 
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as 
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this General 
Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other 
recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with the 
Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy. 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and 
copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above, 
provided that you also do the following: 
a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you 
changed the files and the date of any change; and 
b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole 
or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either with or without 
modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms 
of this General Public License (except that you may choose to grant warranty 
protection to some or all third parties, at your option). 
software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the 
 must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the simplest 
and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an 
appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, 
saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program 
under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General 
Public License. 
d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you 
may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its 
derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the 
other work under the scope of these terms. 
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, 
under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, 
which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or, 
b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give 
any third party free (except for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) 
a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be 
distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or, 
c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the 
corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is allowed only 
for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object 
code or executable form alone.) 
Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means all 
the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it 
need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that 
accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for 
standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating system. 
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program 
except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any attempt 
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program is 
void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under 
this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights to use 
copies, from you under this General Public License will not have their licenses 
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on the 
Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its 
terms and conditions. 
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), 
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the 
rights granted herein. 
7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the 
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in 
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems 
or concerns. 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and "any later 
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you 
 that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. 
If the Program does not specify a version number of the license, you may 
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs 
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for 
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, 
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. 
Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of 
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of 
software generally. 
NO WARRANTY 
9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE 
PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL 
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE 
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY 
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR 
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA 
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A 
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER 
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which 
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach 
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion 
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a 
pointer to where the full notice is found. 
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> 
Copyright (C) 19yy <name of author> 
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it 
under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free 
Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version. 
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but 
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more 
details. 
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with 
this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple 
Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA. 
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it 
starts in an interactive mode: 
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
 comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. 
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under 
certain conditions; type `show c' for details. 
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be 
called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be 
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, 
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here's 
a sample; alter the names: 
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
Version 1, February 1989 
Copyright (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA 
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed. 
Preamble 
The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the 
mercy of those companies. By contrast, our General Public License is intended 
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the 
Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors 
commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too. 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. 
Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have 
the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive 
source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or 
use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these 
things. 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny 
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions 
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the 
software, or if you modify it. 
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for 
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must 
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must 
tell them their rights. 
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) 
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute 
and/or modify the software. 
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the 
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to 
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced 
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. 
3. The name of any author may not be used to endorse or promote products 
derived from this software without their specific prior written permission. 
ALTERNATIVELY, this product may be distributed under the terms of the GNU 
General Public License, in which case the provisions of the GNU GPL are 
required INSTEAD OF the above restrictions. (This clause is necessary due to a 
 notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the 
terms of this General Public License. 
The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on 
the Program" means either the Program or any work containing the Program or a 
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is 
addressed as "you". 
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as 
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this General 
Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other 
recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with the 
Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy. 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and 
copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above, 
provided that you also do the following: 
a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you 
changed the files and the date of any change; and 
b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole 
or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either with or without 
modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms 
of this General Public License (except that you may choose to grant warranty 
protection to some or all third parties, at your option). 
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you 
must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the simplest 
and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an 
appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, 
saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program 
under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General 
Public License. 
d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you 
may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its 
derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the 
other work under the scope of these terms. 
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, 
under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, 
which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or, 
b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give 
any third party free (except for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) 
a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be 
distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or, 
c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. 
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a 
 the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it 
need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that 
accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for 
standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating system. 
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program 
except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any attempt 
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program is 
void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under 
this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights to use 
copies, from you under this General Public License will not have their licenses 
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on the 
Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its 
terms and conditions. 
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), 
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the 
rights granted herein. 
7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the 
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in 
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems 
or concerns. 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and "any later 
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. 
If the Program does not specify a version number of the license, you may 
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs 
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for 
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, 
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. 
Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of 
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of 
software generally. 
NO WARRANTY 
9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE 
PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL 
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE 
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY 
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR 
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA 
corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is allowed only 
for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object 
code or executable form alone.) 
Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means all 
 If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which 
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach 
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion 
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a 
pointer to where the full notice is found. 
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> 
Copyright (C) 19yy <name of author> 
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it 
under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free 
Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version. 
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but 
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more 
details. 
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with 
this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple 
Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA. 
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it 
starts in an interactive mode: 
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author Gnomovision 
comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. 
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under 
certain conditions; type `show c' for details. 
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be 
called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be 
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, 
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here's 
a sample; alter the names: 
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program

one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License. 
o 4.2. Effect of New Versions. 
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered 
Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which 
You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes 
a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or 
otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must 
distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the 
version of the License under which You originally received the Covered 
Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make 
the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the 
License published by the license steward. 
o 4.3. Modified Versions. 
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your 
Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if 
You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the 
license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); 
and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ 
from this License. 
* 5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 
COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT 
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, 
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK 
AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD 
ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL 
DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART 
OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT 
UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 
* 6. TERMINATION. 
o 6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate 
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such 
breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by 
their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License 
shall survive. 
o 6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory 
judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial 
Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as 
Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it 
absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by 
You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to 
indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability 
incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such 
Participant) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor 
Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where 
the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any 
patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such 
Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the 
Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License 
shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and 
automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within 
such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant 
Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written 
 * 7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. 
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING 
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY 
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF 
ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER 
FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN 
IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS 
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL 
INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW 
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR 
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND 
LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
* 8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. 
The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in 
48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software (as 
that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial computer 
software documentation as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). 
Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 
(June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only 
those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu 
of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that 
addresses Government rights in computer software under this License. 
* 9. MISCELLANEOUS. 
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter 
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such 
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it 
enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction 
specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the 
extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such 
jurisdictions conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this 
License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the 
jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original 
Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without 
limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The 
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International 
Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that 
the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not 
apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance 
with the United States export administration regulations (and the export 
control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or 
otherwise make available any Covered Software. 
* 10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. 
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible 
for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization 
of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and 
Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing 
herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. 
ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE 
agreement with Participant.

 a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation 
distributed under this Agreement, and 
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
i) changes to the Program, and 
ii) additions to the Program; 
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are 
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a 
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone 
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to 
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in 
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are 
not derivative works of the Program. 
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program. 
"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are 
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when 
combined with the Program. 
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement. 
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, 
including all Contributors. 
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS 
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants 
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to 
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, 
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and 
such derivative works, in source code and object code form. 
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants 
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under 
Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise 
transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and 
object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the 
Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the 
Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be 
covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any 
other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is 
licensed hereunder. 
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to 
its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any 
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual 
property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability 
to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of 
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the 
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole 
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. 
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to 
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC 
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM 
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 
1. DEFINITIONS 
"Contribution" means:
 3. REQUIREMENTS 
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under 
its own license agreement, provided that: 
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and 
b) its license agreement: 
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and 
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title 
and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability 
and fitness for a particular purpose; 
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for 
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential 
damages, such as lost profits; 
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by 
that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and 
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, 
and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a 
medium customarily used for software exchange. 
When the Program is made available in source code form: 
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and 
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. 
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the 
Program. 
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if 
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the 
originator of the Contribution. 
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION 
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with 
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is 
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who 
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner 
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if 
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such 
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify 
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages 
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal 
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the 
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in 
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product 
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses 
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order 
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial 
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor 
to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and 
any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may 
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that 
license before distributing the Program. 
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient 
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license 
set forth in this Agreement.
 Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the 
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other 
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court 
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial 
Contributor must pay those damages. 
5. NO WARRANTY 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN 
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR 
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, 
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each 
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using 
and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise 
of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and 
costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of 
data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY 
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, 
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST 
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, 
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY 
WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS 
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
7. GENERAL 
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable 
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the 
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such 
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such 
provision valid and enforceable. 
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a 
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself 
(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) 
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted 
under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. 
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to 
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does 
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of 
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, 
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as 
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement 
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue 
and survive. 
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in 
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be 
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to 
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. 
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. 
The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation 
may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable 
separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a 
participate in any such claim at its own expense. 
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product 
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that 
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties 
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such 
 above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of 
any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, 
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under 
this Agreement are reserved. 
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the 
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this 
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year 
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial 
in any resulting litigation.

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, 
Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA 
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed. 
Preamble 
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share 
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to 
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to 
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose 
authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is 
covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to 
your programs, too. 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our 
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always 
be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was 
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, 
Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) 
under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) 
 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny 
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions 
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the 
software, or if you modify it. 
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for 
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must 
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must 
show them these terms so they know their rights. 
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) 
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute 
and/or modify the software. 
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the 
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to 
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced 
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. 
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We 
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. 
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for 
everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. 
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice 
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of 
this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program 
or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any 
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the 
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included 
without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as 
"you". 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by 
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is 
not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents 
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by 
running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as 
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License 
and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the 
Program a copy of this License along with the Program. 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus 
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications 
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of 
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to 
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), 
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change 
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you 
can do these things.
 licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
License. 
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you 
must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most 
ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate 
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that 
you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these 
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. 
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print 
such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print 
an announcement.) 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably 
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and 
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate 
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a 
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms 
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire 
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the 
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on 
the Program. 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the 
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License. 
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under 
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 
2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, 
which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
customarily used for software interchange; or, 
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give 
any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing 
source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding 
source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a 
medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute 
corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial 
distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable 
form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all 
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation 
of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code 
distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either 
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) 
of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
these conditions: 
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that 
you changed the files and the date of any change. 
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in 
part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be 
itself accompanies the executable.
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy 
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source 
code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though 
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as 
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, 
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate 
 or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not 
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or 
any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to 
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
the Program or works based on it. 
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), 
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipiyour rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or 
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so 
long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program 
ents' exercise of the 
rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this 
License. 
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions 
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that 
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the 
conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy 
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. 
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution 
of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through 
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or 
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this 
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software 
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many 
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to 
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that 
choice. 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
consequence of the rest of this License. 
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain 
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original 
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit 
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that 
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In 
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body 
of this License. 
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the 
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in 
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems 
or concerns. 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later 
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. 
If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may 
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
 PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL 
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE 
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY 
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR 
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA 
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A 
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER 
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software 
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach 
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion 
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a 
pointer to where the full notice is found. 
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> 
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> 
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under 
the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software 
Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later 
version. 
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY 
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details. 
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with 
this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin 
Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.Also add information on how to 
contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it 
starts in an interactive mode: 
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author 
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. 
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain 
conditions; type `show c' for details. 
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be 
called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be 
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs 
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for 
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, 
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. 
Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of 
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of 
software generally. 
NO WARRANTY 
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may 
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the 
library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public

forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications 
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of 
these conditions: 
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that 
you changed the files and the date of any change. 
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in 
part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be 
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
License. 
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you 
must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most 
ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate 
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that 
you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these 
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. 
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print 
such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print 
an announcement.) 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably 
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and 
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate 
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the 
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to 
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced 
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. 
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We 
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. 
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for 
everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. 
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, 
which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
customarily used for software interchange; or, 
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give 
any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing 
source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding 
source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a 
medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute 
corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial 
distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable 
form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all 
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation 
of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code 
distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either 
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) 
of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable.
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy 
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source 
code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though 
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as 
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, 
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate 
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or 
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so 
long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program 
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not 
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or 
any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to 
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
the Program or works based on it. 
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), 
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the 
rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this 
License. 
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a 
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms 
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire 
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the 
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on 
the Program. 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the 
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License. 
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under 
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 
 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or 
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this 
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software 
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many 
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to 
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that 
choice. 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
consequence of the rest of this License. 
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain 
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original 
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit 
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that 
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In 
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body 
of this License. 
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the 
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in 
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems 
or concerns. 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later 
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. 
If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may 
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs 
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for 
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, 
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. 
Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of 
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of 
software generally. 
NO WARRANTY 
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL 
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions 
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that 
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the 
conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy 
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. 
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution 
of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through 
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may 
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the 
library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software 
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach 
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion 
 you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are not 
obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception

subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but 
only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header 
the words "Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath" 
exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code." 
Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a 
combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU 
General Public License cover the whole combination. 
As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you 
permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an 
executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and 
to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, 
provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and 
conditions of the license of that module. An independent module is a module 
which is not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this library, 
 computer software code that is originally released under this License.

following: 
A. Any file that results from an addition to, deletion from or 
modification of the contents of a file containing Original Software or previous 
Modifications; 
B. Any new file that contains any part of the Original Software or 
previous Modification; or 
C. Any new file that is contributed or otherwise made available under the 
terms of this License. 
1.10. "Original Software" means the Source Code and Executable form of 
 portions of such combination). 
(c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on 
the date Contributor first distributes or otherwise makes the Modifications 
available to a third party. 
(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: 
(1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; (2) 
for infringements caused by: (i) third party modifications of Contributor 
Version, or (ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with 
other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 
(3) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of 
Modifications made by that Contributor. 
3. Distribution Obligations. 
3.1. Availability of Source Code. 
Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in 
Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source 
Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must 
include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the 
Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform 
recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can 
obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or 
through a medium customarily used for software exchange. 
3.2. Modifications. 
The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by 
the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications 
are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the 
rights conveyed by this License. 
3.3. Required Notices. 
You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You 
as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any 
copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, 
or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any 
Contributor or the Initial Developer. 
3.4. Application of Additional Terms. 
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code 
form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the 
recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, 
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients 
Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject to third 
party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a 
world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license: 
(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) 
Licensable by Contributor to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, 
sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or 
portions thereof), either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as 
Covered Software and/or as part of a Larger Work; and 
(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of 
Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with 
its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, 
offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: (1) Modifications made 
by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and (2) the combination of 
Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or 
 Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it 
absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by 
You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to 
indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability 
incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such 
terms You offer. 
3.6. Larger Works. 
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code 
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a 
single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this 
License are fulfilled for the Covered Software. 
4. Versions of the License. 
4.1. New Versions. 
Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new 
versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a 
distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other 
than the license steward has the right to modify this License. 
4.2. Effect of New Versions. 
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered 
Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which 
You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes 
a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or 
otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must 
distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the 
version of the License under which You originally received the Covered 
Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make 
the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the 
License published by the license steward. 
4.3. Modified Versions. 
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for 
Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this 
License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of 
the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this 
License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which 
differ from this License. 
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 
COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT 
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on 
behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely 
clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is 
offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer 
and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or 
such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms 
You offer. 
3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. 
You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the 
terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may 
contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance 
with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form 
does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code 
form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered 
 6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory 
judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial 
Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as 
"Participant") alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor 
Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where 
the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any 
patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such 
Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the 
Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License 
shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and 
automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within 
such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant 
Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written 
agreement with Participant. 
6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging 
that the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where 
such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the 
initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the 
licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken 
into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. 
6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end 
user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor 
hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any 
distributor) shall survive termination. 
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. 
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING 
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY 
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF 
ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR 
MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH 
PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS 
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL 
INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW 
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR 
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND 
LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. 
The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 
C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as that 
term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer 
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, 
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK 
AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD 
ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL 
DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART 
OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT 
UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 
6. TERMINATION. 
6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate 
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such 
breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by 
their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License 
shall survive.
 License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the 
jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original 
Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without 
limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The 
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International 
Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that 
the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not 
apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance 
with the United States export administration regulations (and the export 
control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or 
otherwise make available any Covered Software. 
10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. 
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible 
for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization 
of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and 
Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing 
herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed. 
Preamble 
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share 
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to 
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to 
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose 
authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is 
covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to 
software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 
1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 
227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software 
with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is 
in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision 
that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License. 
9. MISCELLANEOUS. 
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter 
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such 
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it 
enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction 
specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the 
extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such 
jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this 
 show them these terms so they know their rights. 
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) 
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute 
and/or modify the software. 
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the 
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to 
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced 
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. 
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We 
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. 
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for 
everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. 
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice 
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of 
this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program 
or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any 
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the 
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included 
without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as 
"you". 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by 
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is 
not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents 
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by 
running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as 
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License 
and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the 
Program a copy of this License along with the Program. 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
your programs, too. 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our 
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to 
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), 
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change 
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you 
can do these things. 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny 
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions 
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the 
software, or if you modify it. 
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for 
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must 
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must 
 you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these 
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. 
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print 
such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print 
an announcement.) 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably 
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and 
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate 
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a 
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms 
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire 
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the 
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on 
the Program. 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the 
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License. 
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under 
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 
2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, 
which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
customarily used for software interchange; or, 
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give 
any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing 
source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding 
source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a 
medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute 
corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial 
distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable 
form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all 
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation 
of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code 
distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either 
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) 
of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable.
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus 
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications 
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of 
these conditions: 
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that 
you changed the files and the date of any change. 
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in 
part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be 
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
License. 
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you 
must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most 
ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate 
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that 
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source 
code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though 
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 
 the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the 
rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this 
License. 
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions 
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that 
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the 
conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy 
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. 
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution 
of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through 
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or 
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this 
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software 
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many 
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to 
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that 
choice. 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
consequence of the rest of this License. 
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain 
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original 
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit 
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that 
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In 
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body 
of this License. 
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the 
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in 
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems 
or concerns. 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later 
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. 
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as 
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, 
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate 
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or 
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so 
long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program 
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not 
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or 
any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to 
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
the Program or works based on it. 
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), 

 INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL 
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE 
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY 
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR 
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA 
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A 
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER 
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software 
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach 
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion 
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a 
pointer to where the full notice is found. 
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> 
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> 
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under 
the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software 
Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later 
version. 
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY 
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details. 
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with 
this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin 
Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.Also add information on how to 
contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it 
starts in an interactive mode: 
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author 
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. 
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain 
conditions; type `show c' for details. 
If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may 
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs 
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for 
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, 
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. 
Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of 
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of 
software generally. 
NO WARRANTY 
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
 library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public 
License instead of this License. 
"CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL 
Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates are 
subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but 
only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header 
the words "Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath" 
exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code." 
Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a 
combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU 
General Public License cover the whole combination. 
As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you 
permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an 
executable, regardless of the liThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be 
called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be 
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, 
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here 
is a sample; alter the names: 
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program 
Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker. 
<signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989 
Ty Coon, President of Vice 
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may 
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the 
cense terms of these independent modules, and 
to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, 
provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and 
conditions of the license of that module. An independent module is a module 
which is not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this library, 
you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are not 
obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception 
statement from your version.

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed. 
Preamble 
 sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that 
their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous 
versions. 
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified 
versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. 
This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to 
change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area 
of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most 
unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit 
the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other 
domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future 
versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. 
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States 
should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on 
general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special 
danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively 
proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to 
render the program non-free. 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
0. Definitions.
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and 
other kinds of works. 
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take 
away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General 
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all 
versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. 
We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most 
of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its 
authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our 
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to 
distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you 
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the 
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do 
these things. 
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights 
or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain 
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: 
responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. 
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for 
a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. 
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you 
must show them these terms so they know their rights. 
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:(1) assert 
copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal 
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. 
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that 
there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' 
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. 
 modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work. 
A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard 
defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified 
for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers 
working in that language. 
The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the 
work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major 
Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only 
to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard 
Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code 
form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component 
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on 
which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an 
object code interpreter used to run it. 
The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source 
code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object 
code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. 
However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose 
tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in 
performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, 
Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source 
files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically 
"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, 
such as semiconductor masks. 
"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. 
Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be 
individuals or organizations. 
To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a 
fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. 
The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a 
work "based on" the earlier work. 
A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the 
Program. 
To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, 
would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable 
copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. 
Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), 
making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. 
To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to 
make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer 
network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. 
An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the 
extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) 
displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is 
no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), 
that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy 
of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, 
such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 
1. Source Code. 
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as 
by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and 
other parts of the work. 
 copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or 
restricting circumvention of such measures. 
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid 
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is 
effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered 
work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the 
work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' 
legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 
4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. 
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, 
in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on 
each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that 
this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply 
to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give 
all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. 
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may 
offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 
5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. 
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it 
from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, 
provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 
a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and 
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate 
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding 
Source for a work in source code form is that same work. 
2. Basic Permissions. 
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on 
the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This 
License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified 
Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License 
only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This 
License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided 
by copyright law. 
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without 
conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. 
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make 
modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running 
those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in 
conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus 
making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your 
behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from 
making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with 
you. 
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the 
conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it 
unnecessary. 
3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. 
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure 
under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO 
giving a relevant date. 
 b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a 
physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at 
least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer 
support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code 
either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the 
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium 
customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your 
reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) 
access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. 
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer 
to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only 
occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with 
such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. 
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or 
for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the 
same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require 
recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the 
place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may 
be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports 
equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to 
the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of 
what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that 
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this 
License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies 
the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices". 
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone 
who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along 
with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and 
all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no 
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate 
such permission if you have separately received it. 
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate 
Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not 
display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. 
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, 
which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not 
combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a 
storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and 
its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the 
compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a 
covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other 
parts of the aggregate. 
6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. 
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 
and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source 
under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: 
a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product(including a 
physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on 
a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. 
it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. 
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform 
other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are 
being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A 
separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the 
Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the 
 requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a 
work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User 
Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be 
denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the 
operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication 
across the network. 
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord 
with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an 
implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require 
no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. 
7. Additional Terms. 
"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by 
making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. 
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be 
treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they 
are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part 
of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but 
the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the 
additional permissions. 
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any 
additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional 
object code work. 
A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible 
personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household 
purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. 
In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be 
resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a 
particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that 
class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way 
in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, 
the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product 
has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses 
represent the only significant mode of use of the product. 
"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, 
authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute 
modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified 
version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure 
that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case 
prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made. 
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or 
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a 
transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is 
transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of 
how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under 
this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this 
requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the 
ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the 
work has been installed in ROM). 
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a 
permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when 
you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added 
by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright 
permission. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a 
covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) 
 Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a 
separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements 
apply either way. 
8. Termination. 
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided 
under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, 
and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any 
patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). 
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a 
particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until 
the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) 
permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by 
some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. 
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated 
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some 
reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation 
of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the 
violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. 
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses 
of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If 
your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not 
supplement the terms of this License with terms: 
a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of 
sections 15 and 16 of this License; or 
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author 
attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by 
works containing it; or 
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring 
that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as 
different from the original version; or 
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of 
the material; or 
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, 
trademarks, or service marks; or 
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by 
anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual 
assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these 
contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. 
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions" 
within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any 
part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along 
with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a 
license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or 
conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed 
by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction 
does not survive such relicensing or conveying. 
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, 
in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to 
those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. 
qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. 
 making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any 
portion of it. 
11. Patents. 
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of 
the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is 
called the contributor's "contributor version". 
A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or 
controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, 
that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, 
using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would 
be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor 
version. For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to 
grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this 
License. 
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent 
license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, 
offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of 
its contributor version. 
In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express agreement 
or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express 
permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent 
infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such 
9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. 
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy 
of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a 
consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does 
not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you 
permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe 
copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or 
propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do 
so. 
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. 
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a 
license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, 
subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by 
third parties with this License. 
An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an 
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an 
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work 
results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives 
a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's 
predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a 
right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the 
predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with 
reasonable efforts. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights 
granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a 
license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this 
License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or 
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by 
an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. 
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the 
Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of 
charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available 
 Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied 
license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to 
you under applicable patent law. 
12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. 
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse 
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work 
so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any 
other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at 
all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty 
for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way 
you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain 
entirely from conveying the Program. 
13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to 
link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the 
GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey 
the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the 
part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero 
General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network 
will apply to the combination as such. 
14. Revised Versions of this License.
network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) 
cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive 
yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) 
arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to 
extend the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means 
you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the 
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a 
country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that 
you have reason to believe are valid. 
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you 
convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a 
patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing 
them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, 
then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients 
of the covered work and works based on it. 
A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope of 
its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise 
of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. 
You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a 
third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you 
make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of 
conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the 
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent 
license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or 
copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with 
specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you 
entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 
March 2007. 
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU 
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in 
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems 
or concerns. 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program

INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE 
PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY 
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. 
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot 
be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall 
apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil 
liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of 
liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. 
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software 
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach 
them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion 
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a 
pointer to where the full notice is found. 
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> 
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License "or 
any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms 
and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version 
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a 
version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version 
ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the 
GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of 
acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for 
the Program. 
Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. 
However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright 
holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 
15. Disclaimer of Warranty. 
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE 
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR 
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER 
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO 
THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM 
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR 
CORRECTION. 
16. Limitation of Liability. 
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY 
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS 
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE 
This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it 
under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free 
Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any 
later version.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
Version 3, 29 June 2007 
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> 
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed. 
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms 
and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by 
the additional permissions listed below. 
0. Additional Definitions. 
As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General 
Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public 
License. 
"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an 
Application or a Combined Work as defined below. 
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY 
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details. 
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with 
this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. 
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like 
this when it starts in an interactive mode: 
<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> 
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. 
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain 
conditions; type `show c' for details. 
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might 
be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box". 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if 
any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. 
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see 
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. 
The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may 
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the 
library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public

 applicable to that copy. 
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files. 
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header 
file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms 
of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to 
numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, 
inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of 
the following: 
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is 
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. 
b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license 
document. 
4. Combined Works. 
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, 
effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library 
contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such 
modifications, if you also do each of the following: 
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library 
is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. 
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license 
document. 
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, 
An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the 
Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass 
of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface 
provided by the Library. 
A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application 
with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the 
Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version". 
The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding 
Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the 
Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and 
not on the Linked Version. 
The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code 
and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs 
needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding 
the System Libraries of the Combined Work. 
1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL. 
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without 
being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL. 
2. Conveying Modified Versions. 
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility 
refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the 
facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then 
you may convey a copy of the modified version: 
a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure 
that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the 
facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains 
meaningful, or 
b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License 
include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a 
reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license 
document. 
d) Do one of the following: 
0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this 
License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and 
 form of the same work. 
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License. 
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU 
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be 
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address 
new problems or concerns. 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you 
received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General 
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of 
following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any 
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you 
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public 
License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License 
ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether 
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that 
proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent 
authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

License/Notice: 
Part of the software embedded in this product is gSOAP software. 
under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a 
modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in 
the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding 
Source. 
1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. 
A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library 
already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly 
with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the 
Linked Version. 
e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be 
required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only 
to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a 
modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the 
Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 
4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding 
Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must 
provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of 
the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.) 
5. Combined Libraries. 
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by 
side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not 
Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined 
library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following: 
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the 
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the 
terms of this License. 
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work 
based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined

 the modified Vim you distribute. This may be done in the form of a context 
diff. You can choose what license to use for new code you add. The changes 
and their license must not restrict others from making their own changes to the 
official version of Vim. 
d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned 
under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the changes if the 
following three conditions are met: 
- The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute 
the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and permits the 
Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official version of Vim without 
fee or restriction. 
- You keep the changes for at least three years after last 
distributing the corresponding modified Vim. When the maintainer or someone 
who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in any way) for the changes 
within this period, you must make them available to him. 
- You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you. This 
contact information must remain valid for at least three years after last 
distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as long as possible. 
e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes, you 
can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or any later 
version. 
3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the ":version" 
command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim is able 
to see that it was modified. When distributing as mentioned under 2)e) adding 
the message is only required for as far as this does not conflict with the 
license used for the changes. 
4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be 
removed or changed, except that the person himself can make corrections.
including executables and/or source code, when the following four conditions 
are met: 
1) This license text must be included unmodified. 
2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways: 
a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in the 
distribution how to contact you. When the maintainer asks you (in any way) for 
a copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you must make your changes, 
including source code, available to the maintainer without fee. The 
maintainer reserves the right to include your changes in the official version 
of Vim. What the maintainer will do with your changes and under what license 
they will be distributed is negotiable. If there has been no negotiation 
then this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes. 
The current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>. If this changes it 
will be announced in appropriate places (most likely vim.sf.net, www.vim.org 
and/or comp.editors). When it is completely impossible to contact the 
maintainer, the obligation to send him your changes ceases. Once the 
maintainer has confirmed that he has received your changes they will not have 
to be sent again. 
b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as mentioned 
under a) you are allowed to further distribute it unmodified, as mentioned at 
I). If you make additional changes the text under a) applies to those changes. 
c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of 
III) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use the 
Vim license for your changes and make them available to the maintainer, 
 contact information with the "--with-modified-by" configure argument or the 
MODIFIED_BY define.

Kibaale Children's Centre 
*kcc* *Kibaale* *charity* 
Kibaale Children's Centre (KCC) is located in Kibaale, a small town in the 
south of Uganda, near Tanzania, in East Africa. The area is known as Rakai 
District. The population is mostly farmers. Although people are poor, there 
is enough food. But this district is suffering from AIDS more than any other 
part of the world. Some say that it started there. Estimations are that 10 to 
30% of the Ugandans are infected with HIV. Because parents die, there are many 
orphans. In this district about 60,000 children have lost one or both parents, 
out of a population of 350,000. And this is still continuing. 
The children need a lot of help. The KCC is working hard to provide the needy 
with food, medical care and education. Food and medical care to keep them 
healthy now, and education so that they can take care of themselves in the 
future. KCC works on a Christian base, but help is given to children of any 
religion. 
The key to solving the problems in this area is education. This has been 
neglected in the past years with president Idi Amin and the following civil 
wars. Now that the government is stable again, the children and parents have 
to learn how to take care of themselves and how to avoid infections. There is 
also help for people who are ill and hungry, but the primary goal is to 
prevent people from getting ill and to teach them how to grow healthy food. 
Most of the orphans are living in an extended family. An uncle or older sister 
is taking care of them. Because these families are big and the income (if any) 
is low, a child is lucky if it gets healthy food. Clothes, medical care and 
schooling is beyond its reach. To help these needy children, a sponsorship 
including the source code. The preferred way to do this is by e-mail or by 
uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL. If the number of changes 
is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a context diff will do. The 
e-mail address to be used is <maintainer@vim.org> 
IV) It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the Vim 
sources, parts of it or from a modified version. You may use this license 
for previous Vim releases instead of the license that they came with, at your 
option. 
Note: 
- If you are happy with Vim, please express that by reading the rest of this 
file and consider helping needy children in Uganda. 
- If you want to support further Vim development consider becoming a |sponsor|. 
The money goes to Uganda anyway. 
- According to Richard Stallman the Vim license is GNU GPL compatible. 
A few minor changes have been made since he checked it, but that should not 
make a difference. 
- If you link Vim with a library that goes under the GNU GPL, this limits 
further distribution to the GNU GPL. Also when you didn't actually change 
anything in Vim. 
- Once a change is included that goes under the GNU GPL, this forces all 
further changes to also be made under the GNU GPL or a compatible license. 
- If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you can include your name and 

 1. Sponsor a child in primary school: 17 euro a month (or more). 
2. Sponsor a child in secondary school: 25 euro a month (or more). 
3. Sponsor the clinic: Any amount a month or quarter 
4. A one-time donation 
Compared with other organizations that do child sponsorship the amounts are 
very low. This is because the money goes directly to the centre. Less than 5% 
is used for administration. This is possible because this is a small 
organization that works with volunteers. If you would like to sponsor a child, 
you should have the intention to do this for at least one year. 
How do you know that the money will be spent right? First of all you have my 
personal guarantee as the author of Vim. I trust the people that are working 
at the centre, I know them personally. Further more, the centre has been 
co-sponsored and inspected by World Vision, Save the Children Fund and is now 
under the supervision of Pacific Academy Outreach Society. The centre is 
visited about once a year to check the progress (at our own cost). I have 
visited the centre myself many times, starting in 1993. The visit reports are 
on the ICCF web site. 
If you have any further questions, send me e-mail: <Bram@vim.org>. 
The address of the centre is:

program was put into place. A child can be financially adopted. 
For a few dollars a month KCC sees to it that the child gets indispensable 
items, is healthy, goes to school and KCC takes care of anything else that 
needs to be done for the child and the family that supports it. 
Besides helping the child directly, the environment where the child grows up 
needs to be improved. KCC helps schools to improve their teaching methods. 
There is a demonstration school at the centre and teacher trainings are given. 
Health workers are being trained, hygiene education is carried out and 
households are stimulated to build a proper latrine. I helped setting up a 
production site for cement slabs. These are used to build a good latrine. They 
are sold below cost price. 
There is a small clinic at the project, which provides children and their 
family with medical help. When needed, transport to a hospital is offered. 
Immunization programs are carried out and help is provided when an epidemic is 
breaking out (measles and cholera have been a problem). 
*donate* 
Summer 1994 to summer 1995 I spent a whole year at the centre, working as a 
volunteer. I have helped to expand the centre and worked in the area of water 
and sanitation. I learned that the help that the KCC provides really helps. 
When I came back to Holland, I wanted to continue supporting KCC. To do this 
I'm raising funds and organizing the sponsorship program. Please consider one 
of these possibilities: 
US checks can be sent to them to lower banking costs. 
Canada: Contact Kibaale Children's Fund (KCF) in Surrey, Canada. They take 
care of the Canadian sponsors for the children in Kibaale. KCF forwards 100% 
of the money to the project in Uganda. You can send them a one time donation 
directly. Please send me a note so that I know what has been donated because of 
Vim. Ask KCF for information about sponsorship.

World: Use a postal money order. That should be possible from any 
country, mostly from the post office. Use this name (which is in my passport): 
"Abraham Moolenaar". Use Euro for the currency if possible. 
Europe: Use a bank transfer if possible. Your bank should have a form that you 
can use for this. See "Others" below for the swift code and IBAN number. Any 
other method should work. Ask for information about sponsorship. 
Credit Card: You can use PayPal to send money with a Credit card. This is 
the most widely used Internet based payment system. It's really simple to use.

To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for 
everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. 
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice 
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of 
this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program 
or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any 
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the 
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included 
without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as 
"you". 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by 
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is 
not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents 
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by 
running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as 
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose 
authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is 
covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to 
your programs, too. 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our 
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to 
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), 
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change 
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you 
can do these things. 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny 
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions 
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the 
software, or if you modify it. 
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License 
and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the 
Program a copy of this License along with the Program. 
 copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that 
you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these 
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. 
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print 
such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print 
an announcement.) 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably 
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and 
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate 
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a 
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms 
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire 
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the 
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on 
the Program. 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the 
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License. 
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under 
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 
2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, 
which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
customarily used for software interchange; or, 
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give 
any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing 
source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding 
source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a 
medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute 
corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial 
distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable 
form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus 
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications 
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of 
these conditions: 
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that 
you changed the files and the date of any change. 
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in 
part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be 
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
License. 
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you 
must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most 
ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all 
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation 
of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code 
distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either 
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) 
of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable.
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy 
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source 
 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), 
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the 
rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this 
License. 
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions 
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that 
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the 
conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy 
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. 
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution 
of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or incode from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though 
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as 
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, 
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate 
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or 
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so 
long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program 
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not 
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or 
any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to 
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
the Program or works based on it.
directly through 
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or 
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this 
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software 
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many 
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to 
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that 
choice. 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
consequence of the rest of this License. 
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain 
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original 
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit 
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that 
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In 
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body 
of this License. 
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the 
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in 
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems 
or concerns. 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
 If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software 
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach 
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion 
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a 
pointer to where the full notice is found. 
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under 
the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY 
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A

this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin

contact you by electronic and paper mail.

specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later 
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. 
If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may 
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs 
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for 
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, 
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. 
Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of 
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of 
software generally. 
NO WARRANTY 
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL 
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE 
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY 
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR 
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA 
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A 
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER 
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. 
We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most 
of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its 
authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our 
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to 
distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you 
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the 
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do 
these things. 
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights 
or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain 
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: 
responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. 
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for 
a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. 
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you 
must show them these terms so they know their rights. 
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:(1) assert 
copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal 
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain 
conditions; type `show c' for details. 
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be 
called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be 
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, 
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here 
is a sample; alter the names:

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may 
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the 
library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public 
License instead of this License.

License/Notice: 
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
Version 3, 29 June 2007 
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> 
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed. 
Preamble 
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and 
other kinds of works. 
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take 
away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General 
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all 
 To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a 
fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. 
The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a 
work "based on" the earlier work. 
A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the 
Program. 
To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, 
would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable 
copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. 
Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), 
making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. 
To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to 
make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer 
network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. 
An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the 
extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) 
displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is 
no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), 
that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy 
of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, 
such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. 
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that 
there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' 
sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that 
their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous 
versions. 
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified 
versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. 
This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to 
change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area 
of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most 
unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit 
the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other 
domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future 
versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. 
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States 
should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on 
general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special 
danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively 
proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to 
render the program non-free. 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
0. Definitions. 
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. 
"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, 
such as semiconductor masks. 
"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. 
Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and 
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
 All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on 
the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This 
License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified 
Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License 
only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This 
License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided 
by copyright law. 
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without 
conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey 
covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications 
exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, 
provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all 
material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running 
the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your 
direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of 
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. 
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the 
conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it 
unnecessary. 
3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. 
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure 
under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO 
1. Source Code. 
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work. 
A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard 
defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified 
for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers 
working in that language. 
The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the 
work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major 
Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only 
to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard 
Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code 
form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component 
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on 
which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an 
object code interpreter used to run it. 
The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source 
code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object 
code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. 
However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose 
tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in 
performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, 
Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source 
files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically 
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as 
by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and 
other parts of the work. 
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate 
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding 
Source for a work in source code form is that same work. 
2. Basic Permissions.
 such permission if you have separately received it. 
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate 
Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not 
display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. 
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, 
which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not 
combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a 
storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and 
its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the 
compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a 
covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other 
parts of the aggregate. 
6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. 
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 
and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source 
under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: 
a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product(including a 
physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on 
a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. 
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a 
copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or 
restricting circumvention of such measures. 
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid 
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is 
effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered 
work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the 
work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' 
legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 
4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. 
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, 
in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on 
each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that 
this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply 
to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give 
all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. 
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may 
offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 
5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. 
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it 
from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, 
provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 
a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and 
giving a relevant date. 
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this 
License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies 
the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices". 
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone 
who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along 
with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and 
all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no 
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate 
 In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be 
resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a 
particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that 
class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way 
in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, 
the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product 
has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses 
represent the only significant mode of use of the product. 
"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, 
authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute 
modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified 
version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure 
that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case 
prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made. 
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or 
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a 
transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is 
transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of 
how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under 
this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this 
requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the 
ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the 
work has been installed in ROM). 
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a 
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a 
work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User 
Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be 
physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at 
least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer 
support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code 
either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the 
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium 
customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your 
reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) 
access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. 
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer 
to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only 
occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with 
such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. 
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or 
for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the 
same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require 
recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the 
place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may 
be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports 
equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to 
the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of 
what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that 
it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. 
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform 
other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are 
being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. 
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the 
Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the 
object code work. 
A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible 
personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household 
purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. 
 that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as 
different from the original version; or 
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of 
the material; or 
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, 
trademarks, or service marks; or 
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by 
anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual 
assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these 
contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. 
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions" 
within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any 
part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along 
with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a 
license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or 
conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed 
by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction 
does not survive such relicensing or conveying. 
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, 
in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to 
those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. 
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a 
separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements 
apply either way. 
denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the 
operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication 
across the network. 
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord 
with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an 
implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require 
no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. 
7. Additional Terms. 
"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by 
making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions 
that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were 
included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable 
law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part 
may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains 
governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions. 
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any 
additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional 
permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when 
you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added 
by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright 
permission. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a 
covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) 
supplement the terms of this License with terms: 
a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of 
sections 15 and 16 of this License; or 
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author 
attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by 
works containing it; or 
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring 
 license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, 
subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by 
third parties with this License. 
An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an 
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an 
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work 
results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives 
a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's 
predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a 
right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the 
predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with 
reasonable efforts. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights 
granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a 
license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this 
License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or 
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by 
making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any 
portion of it. 
11. Patents. 
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of 
the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is 
8. Termination. 
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided 
under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, 
and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any 
patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). 
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a 
particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until 
the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) 
permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by 
some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. 
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated 
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some 
reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation 
of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the 
violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. 
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses 
of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If 
your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not 
qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. 
9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. 
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy 
of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a 
consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does 
not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you 
permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe 
copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or 
propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do 
so. 
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. 
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a 
 convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a 
patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing 
them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, 
then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients 
of the covered work and works based on it. 
A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope of 
its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise 
of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. 
You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a 
third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you 
make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of 
conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the 
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent 
license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or 
copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with 
specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you 
entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 
March 2007. 
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied 
license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to 
you under applicable patent law. 
12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. 
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse 
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work 
called the contributor's "contributor version". 
A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or 
controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, 
that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, 
using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would 
be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor 
version. For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to 
grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this 
License. 
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent 
license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, 
offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of 
its contributor version. 
In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express agreement 
or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express 
permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent 
infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such 
an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. 
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the 
Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of 
charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available 
network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) 
cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive 
yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) 
arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to 
extend the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means 
you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the 
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a 
country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that 
you have reason to believe are valid. 
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you 
 However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright 
holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 
15. Disclaimer of Warranty. 
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE 
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR 
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER 
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO 
THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM 
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR 
CORRECTION. 
16. Limitation of Liability. 
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY 
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS 
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE 
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED 
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE 
PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY 
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. 
so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any 
other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at 
all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty 
for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way 
you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain 
entirely from conveying the Program. 
13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to 
link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the 
GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey 
the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the 
part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero 
General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network 
will apply to the combination as such. 
14. Revised Versions of this License. 
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU 
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in 
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems 
or concerns. 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License "or 
any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms 
and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version 
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a 
version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version 
ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the 
GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of 
acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for 
the Program. 
Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. 
 This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain 
conditions; type `show c' for details. 
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might 
be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box". 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if 
any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. 
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see 
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. 
The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may 
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the 
library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public 
License instead of this License. But first, please read 
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

License/Notice: 
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot 
be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall 
apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil 
liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of 
liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. 
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software 
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach 
them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion 
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a 
pointer to where the full notice is found. 
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> 
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> 
This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under 
the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software 
Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later 
version. 
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY 
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details. 
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with 
this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. 
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like 
this when it starts in an interactive mode: 
<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> 
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. 
 Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the 
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to 
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced 
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. 
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We 
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. 
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for 
everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. 
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice 
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of 
this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program 
or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any 
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the 
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included 
Version 2, June 1991 
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, 
Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA 
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed. 
Preamble 
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share 
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to 
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to 
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose 
authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is 
covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to 
your programs, too. 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our 
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to 
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), 
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change 
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you 
can do these things. 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny 
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions 
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the 
software, or if you modify it. 
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for 
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must 
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must 
show them these terms so they know their rights. 
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) 
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute 
and/or modify the software.
 (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print 
such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print 
an announcement.) 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably 
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and 
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate 
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a 
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms 
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire 
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the 
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on 
the Program. 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the 
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License. 
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under 
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 
2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, 
which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
customarily used for software interchange; or, 
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give 
any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing 
source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding 
source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a 
without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as 
"you". 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by 
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is 
not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents 
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by 
running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as 
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License 
and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the 
Program a copy of this License along with the Program. 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus 
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications 
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of 
these conditions: 
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that 
you changed the files and the date of any change. 
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in 
part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be 
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
License. 
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you 
must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most 
ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate 
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that 
you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these 
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. 
medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute 
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the 
rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this 
License. 
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions 
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that 
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the 
conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy 
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. 
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution 
of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through 
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or 
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this 
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software 
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many 
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to 
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that 
choice. 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial 
distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable 
form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all 
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation 
of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code 
distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either 
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) 
of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable.
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy 
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source 
code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though 
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as 
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, 
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate 
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or 
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so 
long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program 
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not 
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or 
any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to 
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
the Program or works based on it. 
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), 
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
consequence of the rest of this License. 
 PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL 
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE 
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY 
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR 
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA 
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A 
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER 
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software 
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach 
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion 
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a 
pointer to where the full notice is found. 
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> 
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> 
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under 
the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software 
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain 
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original 
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit 
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that 
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In 
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body 
of this License. 
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the 
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in 
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems 
or concerns. 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later 
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. 
If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may 
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs 
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for 
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, 
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. 
Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of 
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of 
software generally. 
NO WARRANTY 
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA 
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed. 
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the 
successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version 
number 2.1.] 
Preamble 
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share 
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to 
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
software is free for all its users. 
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially 
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software 
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we 
suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may 
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the 
library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public 
License instead of this License.
 the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this 
license. 
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU 
General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, 
applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the 
ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in 
order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. 
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared 
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a 
derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License 
therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria 
of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for 
linking other code with the library. 
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less 
to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It 
also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over 
competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the 
ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser 
license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. 
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the 
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto 
standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the 
library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as 
widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by 
limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General 
Public License. 
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs 
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For 
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many 
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, 
based on the explanations below. When we speak of free software, we are 
referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are 
designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free 
software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source 
code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use 
pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do 
these things. 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors 
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These 
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute 
copies of the library or if you modify it. 
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a 
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must 
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link 
other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the 
recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes 
to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they 
know their rights. 
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, 
and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, 
distribute and/or modify the library. 
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no 
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone 
else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the 
original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected 
by problems that might be introduced by others. 
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free 
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the 
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent 
holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of 
more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the 
GNU/Linux operating system. 
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' 
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the 
Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a 
modified version of the Library. 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the 
library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived 
from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order 
to run. 
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program 
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized 
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General 
Public License (also called "this License"). 
Each licensee is addressed as "you". 
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as 
to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those 
functions and data) to form executables. 
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has 
been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either 
the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work 
containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with 
modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. 
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 
"modification".) 
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source 
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition 
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the 
library. 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by 
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using 
the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only 
if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use 
of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what 
the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. 
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source 
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License 
and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along 
with the Library. 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus 
forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications 
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of 
these conditions: 
a) The modified work must itself be a software library. 
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that 
you changed the files and the date of any change. 
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all 
third parties under the terms of this License. 
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of 
data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other 
than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a 
good faith effort to ensure that,in the event an application does not supply 
such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part 
of its purpose remains meaningful.
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose 
that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, 
Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by 
this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the 
square root function must still compute square roots.) 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
 its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate 
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a 
work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms 
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire 
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the 
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on 
the Library. 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the 
Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License. 
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License 
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must 
alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the 
ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. 
(If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License 
has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not 
make any other change in these notices. 
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so 
the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and 
derivative works made from that copy. 
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library 
into a program that is not a library. 
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, 
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 
1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding 
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of 
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. 
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a 
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from 
the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even 
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object 
code. 
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is 
designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is 
called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a 
derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this 
License. 
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an 
executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of 
the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is 
therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of 
such executables. 
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is 
part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of 
the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is 
especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the 
work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely 
defined by law. 
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts 
and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less 
in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of 
whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object 
code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) 
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the 
object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables 
containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked 
directly with the Library itself. 
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably 
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and 
 of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided 
that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and 
reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. 
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is 
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You 
must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays 
copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among 
them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. 
Also, you must do one of these things: 
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which 
must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an 
executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work 
that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can 
modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing 
the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents 
of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile 
the application to use the modified definitions.) 
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A 
suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library 
already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library 
functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified 
version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified 
version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. 
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to 
give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a 
charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. 
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a 
designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials 
from the same place. 
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that 
you have already sent this user a copy. 
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Kibrary" must 
include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable 
from it. However, as a special exception,the materials to be distributed need 
not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary 
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating 
system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies 
the executable. 
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of 
other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating 
system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library 
together in an executable that you distribute. 
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library 
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not 
covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that 
the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other 
library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two 
things: 
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the 
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be 
distributed under the terms of the Sections above. 
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it 
is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying 
uncombined form of the same work. 
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library 
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to 
copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and 
will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties 
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have 
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work 
that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions 
 However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library 
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not 
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or 
any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to 
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
the Library or works based on it. 
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), 
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and 
conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' 
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing 
compliance by third parties with this License. 
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions 
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that 
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the 
conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy 
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. 
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution 
of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through 
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or 
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this 
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software 
distribution system which is 
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous 
contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in 
reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor 
to decide if he or she is willing 
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose 
that choice. 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
consequence of the rest of this License. 
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain 
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original 
copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit 
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that 
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In 
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body 
of this License. 
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the 
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be 
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address 
new problems or concerns. 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later 
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. 
If the Library does not specify a license ersion number, you may choose any 
version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs 
whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author 
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
 for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free 
status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and 
reuse of software generally. 
NO WARRANTY 
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL 
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE 
LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY 
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR 
INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA 
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A 
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER 
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries 
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can 
redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under 
these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public 
License). 
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is 
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively 
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the 
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 
<one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA 
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed. 
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the 
successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version 
number 2.1.] 
Preamble 
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share 
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to 
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
software is free for all its users. 
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially 
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software 
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we 
suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary 
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, 
based on the explanations below. When we speak of free software, we are 
referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are 
designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free

that (a) the above copyright notice(s) and this

the above copyright notice(s) and this permission notice appear in associated 
documentation, and (c) there is clear notice in each modified Data File or in 
the Software as well as in the documentation associated with the Data File(s) 
or Software that the data or software has been modified. 
THE DATA FILES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE 
software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source 
code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use 
pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do 
these things. 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors 
 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free 
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the 
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent 
holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of 
the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this 
license. 
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU 
General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, 
applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the 
ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in 
order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. 
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared 
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a 
derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License 
therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria 
of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for 
linking other code with the library. 
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less 
to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It 
also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over 
competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the 
ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser 
license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. 
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the 
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto 
standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the 
library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as 
widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by 
limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General 
Public License. 
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs 
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For 
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many 
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These 
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute 
copies of the library or if you modify it. 
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a 
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must 
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link 
other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the 
recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes 
to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they 
know their rights. 
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, 
and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, 
distribute and/or modify the library. 
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no 
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone 
else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the 
original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected 
by problems that might be introduced by others. 
more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the 
GNU/Linux operating system. 
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' 
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the 
Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a 
modified version of the Library. 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the 
library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived 
from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order 
to run. 
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
 files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the 
library. 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by 
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using 
the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only 
if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use 
of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what 
the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. 
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source 
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License 
and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along 
with the Library. 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus 
forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications 
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of 
these conditions: 
a) The modified work must itself be a software library. 
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that 
you changed the files and the date of any change. 
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all 
third parties under the terms of this License. 
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of 
data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other 
than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a 
good faith effort to ensure that,in the event an application does not supply 
such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part 
of its purpose remains meaningful.
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose 
that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, 
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program 
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized 
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General 
Public License (also called "this License"). 
Each licensee is addressed as "you". 
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as 
to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those 
functions and data) to form executables. 
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has 
been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either 
the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work 
containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with 
modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. 
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 
"modification".) 
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source 
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition 
Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by 
this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the 
square root function must still compute square roots.) 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably 
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and 
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate 
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a 
work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms 
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire 
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the 
 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, 
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 
1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding 
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of 
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. 
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a 
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from 
the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even 
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object 
code. 
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is 
designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is 
called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a 
derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this 
License. 
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an 
executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of 
the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is 
therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of 
such executables. 
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is 
part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of 
the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is 
especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the 
work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely 
defined by law. 
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts 
and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less 
in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of 
whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object 
code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) 
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the 
object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables 
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on 
the Library. 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the 
Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License. 
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License 
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must 
alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the 
ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. 
(If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License 
has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not 
make any other change in these notices. 
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so 
the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and 
derivative works made from that copy. 
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library 
into a program that is not a library. 
containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked 
directly with the Library itself. 
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work 
that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions 
of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided 
that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and 
reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. 
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is 
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You 
must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays 
 c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to 
give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a 
charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. 
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a 
designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials 
from the same place. 
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that 
you have already sent this user a copy. 
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Kibrary" must 
include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable 
from it. However, as a special exception,the materials to be distributed need 
not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary 
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating 
system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies 
the executable. 
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of 
other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating 
system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library 
together in an executable that you distribute. 
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library 
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not 
covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that 
the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other 
library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two 
things: 
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the 
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be 
distributed under the terms of the Sections above. 
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it 
is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying 
uncombined form of the same work. 
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library 
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to 
copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among 
them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. 
Also, you must do one of these things: 
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which 
must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an 
executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work 
that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can 
modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing 
the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents 
of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile 
the application to use the modified definitions.) 
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A 
suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library 
already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library 
functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified 
version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified 
version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. 
copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and 
will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties 
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have 
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library 
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not 
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or 
any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to 
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
the Library or works based on it. 
 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or 
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this 
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software 
distribution system which is 
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous 
contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in 
reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor 
to decide if he or she is willing 
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose 
that choice. 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
consequence of the rest of this License. 
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain 
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original 
copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit 
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that 
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In 
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body 
of this License. 
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the 
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be 
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address 
new problems or concerns. 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later 
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. 
If the Library does not specify a license ersion number, you may choose any 
version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs 
whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author 
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), 
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and 
conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' 
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing 
compliance by third parties with this License. 
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions 
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that 
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the 
conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy 
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. 
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution 
of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through 
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software 
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions 
for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free 
status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and 
reuse of software generally. 
NO WARRANTY 
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL 
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE 
LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY 
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR 
INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA 
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A 
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER 
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries 
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can 
redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under 
these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public 
License). 
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is 
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively 
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the 
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 
<one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.> 
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> 
This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under 
the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free 
Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any 
later version. 
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY 
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details. 
You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along 
with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 
Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA 
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, 
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here 
is a sample; alter the names: 
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library `Frob'

1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 
2) separate from the Original Code; or 
3) for infringements caused by:

Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, 
sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or 
portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as 
Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and 
(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of 
Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with

2) separate from the Contributor Version; 
3) for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor 
Version or ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with

Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this 
License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You 
must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You 
distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version 
that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the 
recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document 
offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. 
3.2. Availability of Source Code. 
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made 
available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the 
same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution 
Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if 
made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for 
at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at 
least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification 
has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring 
that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic 
Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. 
3.3. Description of Modifications.
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file 
documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of 
any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is 
derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial 
Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source 
Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation 
in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 
3.4. Intellectual Property Matters. 
(a) Third Party Claims. 
If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual 
property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor 
under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source 
Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making 
the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If 
Contributor obtains such knowledge after 
the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor 
shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available 
thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing 
lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the 
Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. 
(b) Contributor APIs. 
If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and 
Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to 
implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL 
file. 
(c) Representations. 
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) 
above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's 
other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; 
or 
4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the absence of 
Modifications made by that Contributor. 
3. Distribution Obligations. 
3.1. Application of License. 
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by 
original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the 
rights conveyed by this License. 
3.5. Required Notices. 
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If 
it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to 
its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a 
relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If 
You created one or more Modification(s) 
You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. 
alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every 
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such 
Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You 
offer. 
3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. 
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of 
Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a 
notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available 
under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You 
have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously 
included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or 
collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered 
Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership 
rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from 
this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this 
License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to 
limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the 
rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version 
under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms 
which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial 
Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial 
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial 
Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 
3.7. Larger Works. 
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not 
governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a 
single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this 
License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. 
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. 
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License 
with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, 
or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the 
maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they 
affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in 
Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. 
Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must 
be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to 
understand it. 
5. Application of this License. 
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the 
notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code. 
6. Versions of the License. 
6.1. New Versions. 
Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised and/or new 
versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a 
distinguishing version number. 
6.2. Effect of New Versions. 
You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code 
where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered 
Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, 
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. 
However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the 
Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than 
any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You 
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, 
You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also 
choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of 
the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to 
modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 
6.3. Derivative Works. 
If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do 
in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this 
themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.) 
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT 
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, 
FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE 
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED 
CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY 
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR 
CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS 
LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS 
DISCLAIMER. 
8. TERMINATION. 
8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically 
if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 
days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which 
are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions 
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this 
License shall survive. 
8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim 
(excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a 
Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such 
action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that: 
(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any 
patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under 
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from 
Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of 
notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable 
reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such 
Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the 
Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a 
reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in 
writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights 
granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically 
terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. 
(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's 
Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any 
rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are 
revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or 
had made, Modifications made by that Participant. 
8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging 
that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes 
any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) 
prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable 
value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 
shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment 
or license. 
License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "Mozilla", 
"MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar 
phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs 
from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the 
license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and 
Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, 
Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of 
8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user 
license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been 
validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall 
survive termination. 
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. 
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING 
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY 
FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH 
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF 
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT 
APPLY TO YOU. 
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. 
The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 
2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial 
computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 
(Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 
227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with 
only those rights set forth herein. 
11. MISCELLANEOUS. 
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter 
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such 
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it 
enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions 
(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding 
its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one 
party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in 
the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be 
subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of 
California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing 
party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and 
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations 
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly 
excluded. Any law or regulation whichprovides that the language of a contract 
shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. 
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. 
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible 
for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization 
of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and 
Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing 
herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. 
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. 
Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as 
"Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer 
permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the 
NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in 
the file described in Exhibit A.

Software Components: Network security services(NSS) 3.36.0 
License/Notice: 
NSS is available under the Mozilla Public License, version 2, a copy of which 
is below. 
Note on GPL Compatibility 
------------------------- 
The MPL 2, section 3.3, permits you to combine NSS with code under the GNU 
General Public License (GPL) version 2, or any later version of that 
license, to make a Larger Work, and distribute the result under the GPL. 
The only condition is that you must also make NSS, and any changes you 
have made to it, available to recipients under the terms of the MPL 2 also. 
Anyone who receives the combined code from you does not have to continue 
to dual licence in this way, and may, if they wish, distribute under the 
terms of either of the two licences - either the MPL alone or the GPL 
alone. However, we discourage people from distributing copies of NSS under 
the GPL alone, because it means that any improvements they make cannot be 
reincorporated into the main version of NSS. There is never a need to do 
this for license compatibility reasons. 
Note on LGPL Compatibility 
-------------------------- 
The above also applies to combining MPLed code in a single library with 
code under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1, or 
any later version of that license. If the LGPLed code and the MPLed code 
are not in the same library, then the copyleft coverage of the two 
licences does not overlap, so no issues arise.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope 
The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under 
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the 
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. 
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a 
Contributor: 
(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; 
or 
(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's 
modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its 
Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor 
Version); or 
(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of

or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, 
whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than 
equivalents. 
2.7. Conditions 
Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted 
in Section 2.1. 
3. Responsibilities 
------------------- 
3.1. Distribution of Source Form 
All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any 
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under 
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source 
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this 
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not 
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code 
Form. 
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form 
If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then: 
(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code 
Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of 
the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code 
Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more 
than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and 
(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this 
License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the 
license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter 
the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License. 
3.3. Distribution of a Larger WorkYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, 
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for 
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered 
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the 
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this 
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software 
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of 
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered 
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary 
License(s). 
3.4. Notices 
You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices 
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, 
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of 
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to 
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies. 
2.5. Representation 
Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its 
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights 
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License. 
2.6. Fair Use 
This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under 
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other 
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, 
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional 
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any 
jurisdiction. 
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation 
--------------------------------------------------- 
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this 
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to 
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with 
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) 
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must 
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered 
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute 
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a 
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 
5. Termination 
-------------- 
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically 
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become 
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular 
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such 
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an 
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the 
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have 
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular 
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor 
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the 
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License 
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after 
Your receipt of the notice. 
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent 
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, 
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version 
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to 
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 
2.1 of this License shall terminate. 
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all 
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which 
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License 
prior to termination shall survive termination.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms 
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, 
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered 
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on 
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any

8. Litigation 
------------- 
Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the 
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal 
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that 
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. 
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring 
cross-claims or counter-claims. 
9. Miscellaneous 
---------------- 
This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject 
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be 
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent 
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides 
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter 
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

Software Components: Python 
License/Notice 
A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE 
========================== 
Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting 
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a 
successor of a language called ABC. Guido remains Python's principal author, 
although it includes many contributions from others. In 1995, Guido continued 
his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, 
see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston, Virginia where he released several 
versions of the software. In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development 
team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. In October of the 
same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope 
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com). In 2001, the Python Software Foundation 
(PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization 
created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope 
Corporation is a sponsoring member of the PSF. All Python releases are Open 
Source (see http://www.opensource.org for the Open Source Definition). 
Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; 
the table below summarizes the various releases.

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version 
of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, 
or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license 
steward.

Footnotes: 
(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under the GPL. 
All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version 
without making your changes open source. The GPL-compatible licenses make it 
possible to combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; 
the others don't. 
(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible, because its 
license has a choice of law clause. According to CNRI, however, Stallman's 
lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1 
is "not incompatible" with the GPL. 
Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction 
to make these releases possible.

License/Notice 
The Artistic License 
Preamble 
The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package 
may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of 
artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of 
the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less 
customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications. 
Definitions: 
"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright 
Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual 
modification. 
"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or 
has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder. 
"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for 
the package. 
"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

the above copyright notice appear in all copies and that both that copyright 
notice and this permission notice appear in supporting documentation, and that 
the name of Stichting Mathematisch Centrum or CWI not be used in advertising or 
publicity pertaining to distribution of the software without specific, written 
stify on the basis of media 
cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not 
be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing 
community at large as a market that must bear the fee.) 
"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though 
there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients 
of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it. 
1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the 
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you 
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. 
2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived 
from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in 
such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version. 
3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that 
you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you 
changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them 
Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an 
equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as 
ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications 
in the Standard Version of the Package. 
b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization. 
c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with 
standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate 
manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it 
differs from the Standard Version. 
d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. 
4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable 
form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following: 
a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, 
together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get 
the Standard Version. 
b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the 
Package with your modifications. 
c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard 
Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, 
and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), 
together with instructions on where to get 
the Standard Version. 
d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. 
5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this 
Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You 
may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this 
Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a 
larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not 
advertise this Package as a product of your own. 
6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output 
from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright 
of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold 
commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package. 
 0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a 
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the 
terms of this General Public License. 
The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on 
the Program" means either the Program or any work containing the Program or a 
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is 
addressed as "you". 
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as 
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this General 
Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other 
recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with the 
Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy. 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and 
copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above, 
document, but changing it is not allowed. 
Preamble 
The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the 
mercy of those companies. By contrast, our General Public License is intended 
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the 
Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors 
commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too. 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. 
Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have 
the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive 
source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or 
use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these 
things. 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny 
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions 
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the 
software, or if you modify it. 
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for 
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must 
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must 
tell them their rights. 
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) 
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute 
and/or modify the software. 
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the 
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to 
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced 
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. 
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
provided that you also do the following: 
a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you 
 need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that 
accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for 
standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating system. 
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program 
except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any attempt 
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program is 
void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under 
this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights to use 
copies, from you under this General Public License will not have their licenses 
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on the 
Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its 
terms and conditions. 
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), 
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. 
changed the files and the date of any change; and 
b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole 
or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either with or without 
modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms 
of this General Public License (except that you may choose to grant warranty 
protection to some or all third parties, at your option). 
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you 
must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the simplest 
and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an 
appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, 
saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program 
under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General 
Public License. 
d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you 
may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its 
derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the 
other work under the scope of these terms. 
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, 
under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, 
which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or, 
b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give 
any third party free (except for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) 
a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be 
distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or, 
c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the 
corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is allowed only 
for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object 
code or executable form alone.) 
Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means all 
the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the 
rights granted herein. 
 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which 
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach 
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion 
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a 
pointer to where the full notice is found. 
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> 
Copyright (C) 19yy <name of author> 
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it 
under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free 
Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version. 
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but 
7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the 
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in 
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems 
or concerns. 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and "any later 
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. 
If the Program does not specify a version number of the license, you may 
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs 
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for 
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, 
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. 
Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of 
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of 
software generally. 
NO WARRANTY 
9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE 
PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL 
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE 
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY 
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR 
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA 
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A 
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER 
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more 
details. 
2. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented, either by explicit 
claim or by omission. Credit to the authors and Purdue University must appear 
in documentation and sources.

misrepresented as being the original software.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it 
starts in an interactive mode: 
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author Gnomovision 
comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. 
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under 
certain conditions; type `show c' for details. 
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be 
called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be 
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, 
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here's 
a sample; alter the names:
